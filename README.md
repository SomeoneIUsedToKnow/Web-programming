#About me

![](20230830_201512.jpg)


I am a senior in computer science and I have taken courses such as computer science 3, machine learning, software engineering and projects among a few 
other courses. I have worked on a decision tree and neural network project that predicted whether or not someone has diabetes based on a few factors, 
a game using unreal engine and I worked on the backend part of an application building tables and APIs using javaspringboot and hibernate.
	I see myself using this course as a way to get more hands-on experience with web programming and gaining the skills I need to get into the workforce for 
when I graduate. I will use this course to help develop personal projects that can help me show my experience. With that I also wish to develop a better 
understanding of full stack development as a whole.
